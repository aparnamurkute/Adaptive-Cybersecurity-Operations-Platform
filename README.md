# Threat Intelligence & Incident Management System

##  Objective
Develop a system to integrate threat intelligence feeds with incident response workflows, improving detection and response efficiency.

##  Tools Used
- Python (for parsing TI feeds)  
- MITRE ATT&CK framework  
- Sample JSON/XML threat feeds (e.g., AlienVault OTX, MISP)  
- SIEM tool (Splunk / ELK)  

##  Methodology
1. Collected Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) from open-source threat feeds.  
2. Correlated IOCs with system logs to identify malicious activity.  
3. Automated incident documentation and escalation.  

## Results
- Identified suspicious IPs communicating with internal systems.  
- Reduced time to detect malicious activity by automating IOC matching.  

## Recommendations
- Continuously update TI feeds.  
- Automate integration with SIEM for real-time alerts.  
- Establish incident response playbooks.
